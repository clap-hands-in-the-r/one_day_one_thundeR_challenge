```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## RLe and agregate

```{r}
# rle compute lengths and values of runs of equal values in a vector

x <- c("a","a","a","b","b","c","a","a","b","b","b")

table(x)

y <- round(runif(length(x),1,100))

temp <- rle(x)

df <- data.frame(x,y)

aggregate(y~x, df, sum)

group <- rep(seq_along(temp$values),temp$lengths)

# seq_along generates a sort of indice changing each time 
# the new vector value is changing
temp$lengths
temp$values
df
group

df <- cbind(df,group)

aggregate(y~group,df, sum)

```



## Non standard evaluation

```{r}

head(mtcars)



```

## What is the tilda?


```{r, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
mtcars |> head()
mtcars |> mutate_at(vars(mpg,cyl), ~. *2) |> head()

# tilda acts like an anonymous function


```
